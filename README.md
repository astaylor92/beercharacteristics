# beercharacteristics
A place to work on models to classify beer styles based on their characteristics

# Overall

This was a project to use some data I found from Kaggle to classify beer styles based on their characteristics, primarily tasting notes. If you're curious about the project and process, check out the [page on my website](https://astaylor92.github.io/beer-classification/)

# Files

This is a pretty straightforward repo - Jupyter notebooks with the analysis are in the main folder. Data files were small enough to store in the repo, although they can also be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/beer-profile-and-ratings-data-set)
